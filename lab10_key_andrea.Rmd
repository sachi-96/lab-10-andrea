```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(usethis)
library(beepr)
library(paletteer)
library(sf)

```

## beepr beeps

Use the function 'beep()' in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running.

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
for(i in rev(seq(1:9999))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall"))
}

beep(5)
```

## praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun.

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION}...${exclamation}!!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you.

## Use paletteer to access thousands of color palettes

```{r}
storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(min_pressure = min(pressure, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  slice_min(n = 10, min_pressure) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = min_pressure, y = name)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = name)) +
  scale_fill_paletteer_d("beyonce::X61")

```
